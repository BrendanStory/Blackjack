Blackjack
=========
1. I still can't get it to go past the shuffle method. Heck, I don't even know if it is even shuffling. I've looked at my code, compared it to people with similar codes, tons of things, and still can't find the problem with it.
2. If you change a certain line of code ever so slightly (I forget which one, just go back two commits), it prints out two decks of kings
3. With classes you can make objects that references other documents in the same folder, opening up tons of cross compatability between multiple files.
4. If a method or variable is public, it can be used in any class in the same folder. However, if it is private, it can only be used in the class it was created in.
5. instance variables will be avalible to only the class it was created in, while a class will be usable by all other classes in the same folder
6. If you carry over a method from another class, it will work the same way as the parent method without needing the code to tell it to do so
7. This is used to define objects/variables and keep them in a consistant format. Super is used in inheritance in order to run the parent method
8. Behaviors (Things the object does), and 'name I forget' (Which defines what the object is)
9. Why my Blackjack shuffle code doesn't work >_<, but seriously, I still have trouble with draw/paint methods and stuff based around that.
