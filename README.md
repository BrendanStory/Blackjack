1. I still can't get it to go past the shuffle method. Heck, I don't even know if it is even shuffling. I've looked at my code, compared it to people with similar codes, tons of things, and still can't find the problem with it.

3. With classes you can make objects that references other documents in the same folder, opening up tons of cross compatability between multiple files.
4. If a method or variable is public, it can be used in any class in the same folder. However, if it is private, it can only be used in the class it was created in.
